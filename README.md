# React 17 + TypeScript 4 + Webpack 5
I can't find a boilerplate for these new major versions, so I made one!

### TypeScript
> `npm install typescript`

### Webpack
> `npm install webpack`

To load TypeScript with Webpack, we need `ts-loader`
> `npm install ts-loader`

### React
> `npm install react`

`react-dom` is necessary for react to be used for the web
> `npm install react-dom`

To make react have type declarations for TypeScript
> `npm install @types/react @types/react-dom`
