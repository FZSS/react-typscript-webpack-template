# React 17 + TypeScript 4 + Webpack 5
I can't find a boilerplate for these new major versions, so I made one!

### TypeScript

* `typescript`

* `tsconfig.json` is the config file for TypeScript

### Webpack

* `webpack` 

* `ts-loader`: to load TypeScript with Webpack, we need `ts-loader`

* `webpack-merge`: to merge webpack config files

### React

* `react`

* `react-dom`:  necessary for react to be used for the web

* To make react have type declarations for TypeScript
    > `npm install @types/react @types/react-dom`
